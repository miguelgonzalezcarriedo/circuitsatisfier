The algorithm works on boolean circuits in CNF form to satisfy them.

It works by process of elimination and constraint propagation, where each step introduces a new clause.
Instead of generating full truth tables, it maintains a set of constraints on variables (must be true, must be false, or unknown).

Time Complexity Analysis:
1. For each clause (a ∨ b):
   - Check if already satisfied by current constraints: O(1) since only 2 literals
   - If not satisfied, try each way to satisfy it: O(1) since only 2 literals
   - Create new constraint sets: O(n) to copy variable states
   Total per clause: O(n)

2. For m clauses:
   - Each clause can create up to 2 new constraint sets per existing set
   - After k clauses, we could have up to 2ᵏ constraint sets
   - Each constraint set operation is O(n)
   Total after m clauses: O(n * 2ᵐ) in worst case

The algorithm is not polynomial time because:
1. The number of constraint sets can grow exponentially
2. Each new clause can double the number of constraint sets
3. We need to process all constraint sets for each clause

However, it is often faster than naive truth table generation because:
1. Many constraint sets get eliminated due to conflicts
2. We only branch when a clause is not immediately satisfied
3. We work with constraints instead of explicit assignments

Since conjunction is commutative, we can analyze the circuit iteratively
by starting with the conjunction of the first and second clauses,
and every next step, analyze the conjunction of the accumulated circuit with the next clause.
